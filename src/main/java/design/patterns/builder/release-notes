Step 1 
Create Pizza class 
Define all ingredents as variable 
create  set and getter method for all variable 
create getPizza()
and sysout all varialbe


step 2 create Cook interface  which have all step as method 
    public Pizza buildDough();
	public Pizza setupBase();
	public Pizza spreadSauce();
	public Pizza applyToppings();	
	public Pizza doBaking();
	
Step 3 - Create HeadChef 

declare the Cook(iterface type ) cook 
     private Cook cook;
     
     //create constructor and pass cook

	public HeadChef(Cook cook) {
		this.cook = cook;
	}

///create   method to call all method ( in sequence order) 
	public Pizza deliverPizza() {
		cook.buildDough();
		cook.setupBase();
		cook.spreadSauce();
		cook.applyToppings();
		Pizza pizza = cook.doBaking();
		return pizza;

	}
	
	
	
step 4 - ceate ItalianCook/MexicanCook class and it implement the cook interface 

 and implement the method  
 

Step 5 - create OrderPizza class ( it is test class it have main method)

we  have to create Italin pizza 
we create object of ItalianCook and asssign as Cook(I)
Create Object of HeadChef() --> pass the cook ( it Italian pizza
we call deliveryPizza()and call get Pizza()

	
		//Cook cook = new ItalianCook();-// call italiancook
		Cook cook = new MexicianCook();
	    HeadChef chef = new HeadChef(cook); pass the cook which we want to call 
	    chef.deliverPizza().getPizza();// we call pizza step using( ordered defined in deliveredPizza() 
	    then we call getPizza( ) to sysout
